_[Under construction]_

'''

The purpose of the present document is to provide the basic steps carried out to improve the configuration of BitBucket server in OpenShift.

The improved configuration consists on:

* Persisten Volume Claims
* Health Checks _(pending to be completed)_

== Persisten Volume Claims.
Please notice that the BitBucket server container does not use persistent volume claims by default, which means that the data (e.g.: BitBucket server config.) will be lost from one deployment to another.

*It is very important to create a persisten volume claim in order to prevent the mentioned loss of data.*

=== Step 1: Add storage

=== Step 2: Select the appropriate storage, or create it from scratch if necessary

=== Step 3: Introduce the required information
* *Path* as it is specified in the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/bitbucket-server/[BitBucket server Docker image] (/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket)
* *Volume name* with a unique name to clearly identify the volume
