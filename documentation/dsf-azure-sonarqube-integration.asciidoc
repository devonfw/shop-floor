== Integrate the SonarQube plugin in an Azure DevOps pipeline 
The purpose of this readme is that you can configure your Azure Devops pipeline in order to be able to run a code analysis, analyse the code coverage and publish the results through the Sonar plugin.

== How to do it
==== Step 1: Create a service connection
The first thing to do is to declare your SonarQube server as a service endpoint in your Azure DevOps project settings.

Go to project settings -> pipelines -> service connections and *create* and choose 'SonarQube'.

**Create service connection**

Specify the server url and the connection name of your SonarQube server and the token Auth
Go to your SonarQube server and log in as admin,
once inside, go to administration -> Security -> Users -> Administrator -> Tokens-> And *generate* the token.
Copy the generated token(once created it will never appear again so don't lose it) and paste it and click on *save* .

The service connection has been created.
Once this step is done your service creation will appear now in the _service connections_ side bar.

For more info regarding the Authentication part please read the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/[official documentation]

==== Step 2: Add the required tasks in the azure pipeline
In order to integrate the SonarQube in the pipeline, 3 steps or *tasks* are required(Depending on the different solutions like .NET, Java, C..etc some of this tasks can be optional), this tasks are:

Prepare Analysis configuration
Run Code Analysis
Publish Quality Gate result

We can use the wizard to create this in an easy way, search "SonarQube" and let's configure the tasks one by one.

**Prepare Analysis configuration:**

Fill the required fields and click on *add*

The *prepare* task will be now shown in the pipeline code:

Follow the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/[official documentation] if you have doubts while filling the fields:

Once the *prepare* is done, continue with the code analysis.

**Run Code Analysis**

Select this from the task assistant and just like happened with the first task, the code will appear in your pipeline.

Now, let's publish the result of the analysis.

**Publish quality gate result**

Same as we did before, select in the display the publish extension and add it

==== Step 3: Run the pipeline

With this, all the required steps to integrate SonarQube in your Azure DevOps pipeline are done, the last thing you need to do is **run** your pipeline and your code will be analyzed and the results published.
