= dsf4openshift deployment environment

In this section you will see how you can create a new environment instance in OpenShift and the things that you must add to the Jenkinsfiles of your repository to deploy a branch in this new environment. To conclude you are going to see how to add config files for environment in the source code of the applications.

== Configure your OpenShift to deploy your devonfw projects

=== Prerrequisite

==== OpenShift Cluster

To have your deployment environment with OpenShift you need to have an OpenShift Cluster.

// TODO: For example, you can obtain it from ITAAS

=== Manual configuration

Here you can find all that you need to know to link:dsf-deployment-dsf4openshift-manual-configuration.asciidoc[configure OpenShift] manually.

=== Automatic configuration

Here you can find all that you need to know to link:dsf-deployment-dsf4openshift-automatic-configuration.asciidoc[configure OpenShift] automatically.

== Service integration with jenkins

=== Prerrequisite

To integrate it, you need to have installed the plugin OpenShift Client. To install it go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Manage Plugins_*. Go to Available tab and search it using the filter textbox in the top right corner and install it.

=== Configuration

Second, you need to configure the OC Client. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Global Tool Configuration_*.

Go to OpenShift Client Tools section and add a new one like this.

== Upgrade your Jenkinsfile

Now it is time to add/upgrade the next stages in to your Jenkinsfile:

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile.asciidoc#create-docker-image[create docker image] stage.

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile.asciidoc#deploy-docker-image[deploy docker image] stage.

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile.asciidoc#check-status[check status] stage.

Upgrade link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile.asciidoc#setup-Jenkins-tools[Setup Jenkins tools] stage.

NOTE: Remember to upgrade your parameters to diference which environment is used per branch.
