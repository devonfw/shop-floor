= SonarQube Configuration

To use SonarQube you need to use a token to connect, and to know the results of the analysis you need a webhook. Also, you need to install and configure SonarQube in Jenkins.

== Generate user token

To generate the user token, go to your account clicking in the left icon on the top menu bar.

== Webhook

When you execute our SonarQube scanner in our pipeline job, you need to ask SonarQube if the quality gate has been passed. To do it you need to create a webhook.

Go to administration clicking the option on the top bar menu and select the tab for Configuration.

Then search in the left menu to go to webhook section and create your webhook.

An example for Production Line:

== Jenkins integration

To use SonarQube in our pipelines you need to configure Jenkins to integrate SonarQube.

=== SonarQube Scanner

First, you need to configure the scanner. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Global Tool Configuration_*.

Go to SonarQube Scanner section and add a new SonarQube scanner like this.

=== SonarQube Server

Now you need to configure where is our SonarQube server using the user token that you create before. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Configure System_*.

For example, in ProductionLine the server is the next:

NOTE: Remember, the token was created at the beginin of this SonarQube configuration.
